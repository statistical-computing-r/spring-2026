# Part One: Workflow for Lab Setup

## Step 1: Make a New Project in RStudio
Either under File, or in the top right corner where the current project name is, select

![](images/create-new-project.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of new project option in RStudio under the project name in RStudio"}  


## Step 2: Choose New Project
For now, we are simply creating a New R Project. This will generate a .Rproj file and folder of the same name to store all of our content and set our working directory.  

![](images/choose-new-project.png){fig-alt="Image of New Project Wizard in RStudio where students should select New Project"}


## Step 3: Choose a New Directory
For this week, you will create a **New Directory**. Once we start using GitHub and Git, we may choose Version Control as our option.


![](images/choose-new-directory.png){fig-alt="Image of New Project Wizard with options for New Directory, Existing Director, and Version Control"}

## Step 4: Choose the File Name and Location 
Now set up your file name (for the folder and `.Rproj` file) and the best subdirectory for your Lab 1. This should be a nested folder within your "STAT 210" Folder on your hard drive (Documents), with the "lab" sub-folder, and "week-2" sub-sub-folder. 

Use the file format `your-name-lab-1`

![](images/set-directory-name-location.png){fig-alt="Create New Project window of New Project Wizard in RStudio that allows for specification of Directory Name and File Location"}

## Step 6: Download the `lab-1-student.qmd`

Now download the lab file into your new project folder on your computer. Rename the file so that it reads `lab-1-your-name.qmd` with your first and last name.  

You can download it here: [Lab 1](../student/lab-1-student.qmd)

The file should appear in your project folder under your Files tab in the lower right pane. Click it to open it up. Now that you are all set up, go ahead and get started with the rest of the lab! 


### Optional Alternative Setup for Lab 1

In order to try out GitHub classroom instead of submitting on Canvas, you can setup your lab the following way (only after you have completed the [Week 3 Activities](../../weeks/week-3-version-control.qmd))

#### Step 1: Access GitHub Classroom Assignment  

Click on the following link to create your repository for [Lab 1: Introduction to Quarto](https://classroom.github.com/a/xzjmK1pj).  

You will need to accept the assignment and then go to the link provided for the repository.  

#### Step 2: Copy the HTTPS Link to the Repository

Find the **<> Code** button and select **Local** and then **HTTPS**. Copy the URL for the Repository provided

![](images/selecting-https-github.png){fig-alt="screenshot of GitHub Repository HTTPS link found under CODE in a repository on GitHub"}


#### Step 3: Make a New Project in RStudio
Either under File, or in the top right corner where the current project name is, select

![](images/create-new-project.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of new project option in RStudio under the project name in RStudio"}  


#### Step 4: Choose New Project
For now, we are simply creating a New R Project. This will generate a .Rproj file and folder of the same name to store all of our content and set our working directory.  

![](images/choose-new-project.png){fig-alt="Image of New Project Wizard in RStudio where students should select New Project"}


#### Step 5: Choose a Version Control
Choose **Version Control** and then **Git**. Then paste the HTTPS link to the GitHub repository into the spot for Repository URL. Be sure to check that you are saving the project in the correct sub-directory on your computer.  

![](images/paste-git-https-r.png){fig-alt="Clone Git Repository Screen in RStudio where you paste the link under Repository URL."}

Now you should be set up and ready to go!



# Part Two: Exploring Quarto Documents

## Specifying Global Execute Options

Execution options specify how the R code in your Quarto document should be
displayed. This [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)
provides descriptions on the options you can specify in a document's execution.

To start, your YAML should look something like this:

```         
---
title: "Lab 1: Introduction to Quarto"
author: "Your name goes here!"
date: "Insert the date here!"
format: html
embed-resources: true
editor: source
---
```

**Question 1** -- Add your name and the date to the YAML.

**Question 2** -- Add an `execute` line to your YAML that includes the following
options, (1) your source code is always output on the page, and (2) your
document will render even if there are errors.

## Running the Provided Code

Next, click on the "Play" button on the right of the first auto-populated code
chunk. Alternatively, you can highlight (or simply put your cursor on the line
of) the code you want to run and hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (for
PCs) or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (for Macs).

You should see the code appear in the console, as well as the result of the code
(`2`). Keep in mind the `[1]` before the `2` is vector notation. This means the
result is a *vector* of length 1, whose first element is `2`.

**Question 3** -- Let's spice this code up a bit. Delete `1 + 1` from the code
chunk and paste in the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| label: inspect-toothgrowth-data

# Load a dataset into the R Environment.
data(ToothGrowth)

# Look at the summary of the variables in the dataset.
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

Now run this code. You should see a six-number summary of the variables `len`
and `dose` included in the `ToothGrowth` dataset, as well as the frequency of
the levels contained in the `supp` variable. Further, if you inspect the
Environment tab, the `ToothGrowth` dataset should appear. You can click on the
dataset name (not the blue play button!) to look at the data.

### Check the Data Documentation

**Question 4** -- In your **console** (*not* in the Quarto document), type
`?ToothGrowth` (or alternatively `help(ToothGrowth)`). Use the information that
pops up in the *Help* pane in RStudio to fill in the blanks below.

*This dataset investigates the effect of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on tooth growth 
in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.*

*The two supplement delivery methods include OJ (\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)
and VC (\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_).*

*`ToothGrowth` is a data frame with \_\_\_\_ observations and \_\_\_\_ 
variables.*

**Question 5** -- *Before* the code chunk, change the "Running the Provided
Code" section header to a header that better describes the contents of this
section (e.g., Tooth Growth Dataset).

## Creating a Plot

Your second code chunk is just as boring as your first, so let's spice it up!

**Question 6** -- Replace the `plot(pressure)` code with the following (we will
talk about graphics next week!):

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
#| label: plot-tooth-growth-data
  
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, 
       mapping = aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Supplement", y = "Length of Teeth (mm)")

ToothGrowth %>% 
  mutate(dose = as.factor(dose)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Dose of Supplement (mg/day)", y = "Length of Teeth (mm)")

```

Now, run this code chunk! You should see two side-by-side boxplots, one plot
comparing tooth length between the two supplement delivery methods and one plot
comparing tooth length between the three different dosages uses.

**Question 7** -- Read over the [Quarto documentation on figure options](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#computations) and add an
option (`#|`) to the above code chunk to make the figures print side-by-side
(i.e., in one row) in the rendered HTML file.

**Question 8** -- Specify in the code chunk options that these boxplots should
be **center aligned**.  

**Question 9** -- Specify a **figure caption** for the boxplots (using a
code-chunk option).  

**Question 10** -- Digital accessibility is important. Specify **figure alternative text** for the boxplots (using a code-chunk option). The alt text should describe both figures. 

## Inserting a New Code Chunk

Navigate to the top of your document, just below the YAML code.  We're now going to
insert a new `R` code chunk at the top of the document.

There are four different ways to do this:

1.  Type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> (on a PC) or 
<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> (on a Mac).

2.  Click on the ![](images/insert_code.png){width="5%"} symbol. This should 
automatically default to R code, but if you have a Python compiler on your 
computer, you might need to select "R" from the options.

3.  If you are using the Visual editor, click on the "Insert" button, then 
select "Code Chunk", and finally select "R".

4.  Manually add the code chunk by typing ```` ```{r} ````. Make sure to close
your code chunk with ```` ``` ````.


**Question 11** -- Label the new code chunk as `setup` and add the specification `include: false` as well.  Then move the code `library(tidyverse)` from the code chunk modified in **Question 6** to the `setup` code chunk.  This is best practice for organizing Quarto documents.  



## Creating a More Complex Plot

In this section, we are to create a new plot that you will place in the created code chunk.  

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
#| label: new-plot-tooth-growth-data
  
ToothGrowth %>% 
  mutate(dose = as.factor(dose)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len, fill = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Dose of Supplement (mg/day)", 
       y = "Length of Teeth (mm)",
       fill = "Supplement Type")

```

Carry out the following steps:

**Question 12** -- Navigate to the last sentence of your the Quarto document. Insert a new code chunk.  

**Question 11** -- In the new code chunk, add the code for the graph. Be sure to include a code chunk label and alt text.  

**Question 12** -- Run your code chunk to obtain the output for your new graph.  

**Question 13** -- Create a numbered list containing:

-   Your conclusions (in the context of these data) based on the graph.  
-   A recommendation for how I should get my guinea pig's teeth (odontoblasts) to grow more.  

**Question 13** -- Create another section header, describing the contents of
this section before the graph and list.  

## Render Your Document

Render your document as an **html** file. Use the "Render" button 
(the blue arrow!) at the top of your screen.

If you run into trouble rendering your document, try restarting R and running 
your code chunks in order, and see if you can find the problem.

Another common issue is deleting the tick marks (```` ``` ````) that surround 
your code chunks. If you notice that the code chunks are not showing a "Play"
button (![](images/code-play-button.png){width="5%"}), or that they are not 
highlighted in gray, double check your tick marks!

Recall we included `error: true` in our YAML execution options. This means that
your document will still render even if there are errors. Make sure you are
double checking your work!

You will notice that there is auto-generated text that is unrelated to the work
that you completed. It is always a good idea to delete this extra text!


# Challenge 1: Styling your Quarto Document

You can find a list of every option you can use to format an HTML document [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) and [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html). Further, [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) are lists of 
different themes you can specify in your YAML to produce differently styled
outputs.

Make the following changes to your document:

1.  Specify **"code-folding"** in your YAML document options.

2.  Integrate **"code-tools"** in your YAML document options. 

3.  Add a **table of contents** to your document.

4.  Add a color theme to your document.

## Render again!

Notice that when you render the document, all of the code reruns again, 
producing the same output as before, but with your changes---this is called 
reproducibility!

You should render **often** while completing your practice activities and lab
assignments. Make small changes, then make sure the file still renders rather 
than making a bunch of big changes and then realizing something is wrong.

## Turn it in!

Open the .html file on your computer to make sure it looks as you expected. Then
upload the rendered (.html extension) document to Canvas and the zipped project file as two separate uploads.!

> You'll be doing this same process for all your future Lab Assignments but after next week you will submit a GitHub link instead of the rendered document. Each of these will involve a Quarto file. Some weeks, I may have a template for you to copy like you had here, while other weeks you will generate your own Quarto file from scratch.
