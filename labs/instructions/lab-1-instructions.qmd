# Lab 1: Exploring Quarto Documents

## Specifying Global Execute Options

Execution options specify how the R code in your Quarto document should be displayed. This [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)
provides descriptions on the options you can specify in a document's execution.

To start, your YAML should look something like this:

```         
---
title: "Lab 1: Introduction to Quarto"
author: "Your name goes here!"
date: "Insert the date here!"
format: html
embed-resources: true
editor: source
---
```

**Question 1** -- Add your name and the date to the YAML.

**Question 2** -- Add an `execute` line to your YAML that includes the following options, (1) your source code is always output on the page, and (2) your document will render even if there are errors. Be careful about spacing with each option in the `execute` line.


## Running the Provided Code

Next, click on the "Play" button on the right of the first auto-populated code chunk. Alternatively, you can highlight (or simply put your cursor on the line of) the code you want to run and hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (for PCs) or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (for Macs).

You should see the code appear in the console, as well as the result of the code (`2`). Keep in mind the `[1]` before the `2` is vector notation. This means the result is a *vector* of length 1, whose first element is `2`.

**Question 3** -- Let's spice this code up a bit. Delete `1 + 1` from the code chunk and paste in the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| label: inspect-toothgrowth-data

# Load a dataset into the R Environment.
data(ToothGrowth)

# Look at the summary of the variables in the dataset.
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

Now run this code. You should see a six-number summary of the variables `len` and `dose` included in the `ToothGrowth` dataset, as well as the frequency of the levels contained in the `supp` variable. Further, if you inspect the Environment tab, the `ToothGrowth` dataset should appear. You can click on the dataset name (not the blue play button!) to look at the data.

## Check the Data Documentation

**Question 4** -- In your **console** (*not* in the Quarto document), type `?ToothGrowth` (or alternatively `help(ToothGrowth)`). Use the information that pops up in the *Help* pane in RStudio to fill in the blanks below.

*This dataset investigates the effect of ____________ on tooth growth in ______________.*

*The two supplement delivery methods include OJ (________________) and VC (__________).*

*`ToothGrowth` is a data frame with ________ observations and __________ variables.*

**Question 5** -- *Before* the code chunk, change the "Running the Provided Code" section header to a header that better describes the contents of this section (e.g., Tooth Growth Dataset).

## Creating a Plot

Your second code chunk is just as boring as your first, so let's spice it up!

**Question 6** -- Replace the `plot(pressure)` code with the following (we will talk about graphics next week!):

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
#| label: plot-tooth-growth-data
  
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = ToothGrowth, 
       mapping = aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Supplement", y = "Length of Teeth (mm)")

ToothGrowth %>% 
  mutate(dose = as.factor(dose)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Dose of Supplement (mg/day)", y = "Length of Teeth (mm)")

```

Now, run this code chunk! You should see two side-by-side boxplots, one plot comparing tooth length between the two supplement delivery methods and one plot comparing tooth length between the three different dosages uses.

**Question 7** -- Read over the [Quarto documentation on figure options](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#computations) and add an option (`#|`) to the above code chunk to make the figures print side-by-side (i.e., in one row) in the rendered HTML file.

**Question 8** -- Specify in the code chunk options that these boxplots should be **center aligned** (also found in the Quarto documentation).

**Question 9** -- Specify a **figure caption** for the boxplots (using a code-chunk option).

**Question 10** -- Digital accessibility is important. Specify **figure alternative text** for the boxplots (using a code-chunk option). The alt text should describe both figures.  

::: {.callout-tip}
# Look at the Quarto documentation! 

This is a bit tricky! There are two plots, so you will need
to figure out how to specify a different caption for each plot.

## Inserting a New Code Chunk

Navigate to the last sentence of your the Quarto document. We're now going to insert a new `R` code chunk at the bottom of the document.

There are four different ways to do this:

1.  Type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> (on a PC) or 
<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> (on a Mac).

2.  Click on the ![](images/insert_code.png){width="5%"} symbol. This should 
automatically default to R code, but if you have a Python compiler on your 
computer, you might need to select "R" from the options.

3.  If you are using the Visual editor, click on the "Insert" button, then 
select "Code Chunk", and finally select "R".

4.  Manually add the code chunk by typing ```` ```{r} ````. Make sure to close
your code chunk with ```` ``` ````.





## Render Your Document

Render your document as an **html** file. Use the "Render" button 
(the blue arrow!) at the top of your screen.

If you run into trouble rendering your document, try restarting R and running 
your code chunks in order, and see if you can find the problem.

Another common issue is deleting the tick marks (```` ``` ````) that surround 
your code chunks. If you notice that the code chunks are not showing a "Play"
button (![](images/code-play-button.png){width="5%"}), or that they are not 
highlighted in gray, double check your tick marks!

Recall we included `error: true` in our YAML execution options. This means that
your document will still render even if there are errors. Make sure you are
double checking your work!

You will notice that there is auto-generated text that is unrelated to the work
that you completed. It is always a good idea to delete this extra text!

# Challenge 1: Styling your Quarto Document

You can find a list of every option you can use to format an HTML document [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) and [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html). Further, [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) are lists of 
different themes you can specify in your YAML to produce differently styled
outputs.

Make the following changes to your document:

1.  Specify **"code-folding"** in your YAML document options.

2.  Integrate **"code-tools"** in your YAML document options. 

3.  Add a **table of contents** to your document.

4.  Add a color theme to your document.

## Render again!

Notice that when you render the document, all of the code reruns again, 
producing the same output as before, but with your changes---this is called 
reproducibility!

You should render **often** while completing your practice activities and lab
assignments. Make small changes, then make sure the file still renders rather 
than making a bunch of big changes and then realizing something is wrong.

## Turn it in!

Open the .html file on your computer to make sure it looks as you expected. Then
upload the rendered (.html extension) document to Canvas!

> You'll be doing this same process for all your future Lab Assignments. Each of
> these will involve a Quarto file. Some weeks, I may have a template for you to
> copy like you had here, while other weeks you will generate your own Quarto
> file from scratch.
