## Random Babies Simulation

Perhaps you have seen the [Random Babies applet](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/randombabies/RandomBabies.html)? 
Suppose one night at a hospital some number of babies are born. The hospital
is not very organized and looses track of which baby belongs to each
parent(s), so they decide to return the babies to parents *at random*. 
Here, we are interested in the number of babies that are correctly returned to
their respective parent(s).

**1. Simulate the distribution of the number of babies that are correctly returned if there were four babies born in a night at our disorganized hospital. Use 10,000 simulations. Make sure to add a line of code to make your simulation reproducible every time you run it.**

::: callout-tip
First, write a function to accomplish one simulation (i.e. one night), given a
number of babies (`n_babies`) that were born in a hospital on a given night. 

Then use `map_int()` to run 10,000 simulations assuming 4 babies were born. 

Keep in mind that your function needs to output a single number (not data frame) 
for it to be compatible with `map_int()`!
:::

```{r}
#| label: function-for-random-babies

randomBabies <- function(n_babies){
  ...
}
```

```{r}
#| label: full-simulation-for-random-babies

results <- map_int(.x = 1:10000,
                   .f = 
                  )
```

**2. Create a table displaying the proportion of simulations where 0, 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 babies were given to their correct parent(s).** *Don't forget to use the
`fmt_percent()` function from the **gt** package to add percentage symbols to 
your proportion column!*

::: callout-tip
The output of your `map_int()` is a vector, but to make a nice table (and plot) 
you need this to be a data frame! Luckily, the `enframe()` function does just 
that--it converts a vector to a data frame.

#| label: table-for-random-babies

```

**3. Now create a barplot showing the proportion of simulations where 0, 1, 2,
3, and 4 babies were given to their correct parent(s).** *Don't forget to use the
`label_percent()` function from the **scales** package to add percentage
symbols to your y-axis labels!*

## Simulating Confidence Interval Coverage

Many students struggle with the definition of a confidence interval when first
learning the concept. The interpretation that a lot of textbooks include is 
somthing like "if we were to repeat the study many many times, 95% of the
confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter."

We are going to implement a simulation that illustrates this statistical
concept using confidence intervals for the slope parameter in a linear
regression model.

Let's break it down into a couple of steps.

As a reminder, the typical population model that we assume for a linear
regression is:

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon$$
Where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the population intercept and slope parameters and and $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ is random noise that is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$.

We will design a simulation that uses this as a "data generating model."

**4. Fill in the code below to generate a synthetic dataset with 100 observations. We will assume that the explanatory variable $X$ is uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 and that $\sigma^2$ = 1. The synthetic data should be a data frame with 100 rows and two columns: `x` and `y`.**

```{r}
#| label: data-generation

# define slope and intercept parameters
intercept = 2
slope = 1

# generate x vector


# generate noise `ep` vector


# generate outcome from population model
y = intercept + x*slope + ep


# create an "observed data" dataframe with only the x and y vectors

```

**5. Fit a simple linear regression model of the outcome `y` on `x`.**

```{r}
#| label: fit-linear-model

```

**6. Use the `tidy()` function from the `broom` package to extract a data frame from the `lm()` output that includes the slope estimate and a 95% confidence interval for the slope estimate.**

```{r}
#| label: extract-model-components

```


**7. Check whether the true population slope is inside of the estimated 95% confidence interval for that simulated dataset. Specifically, *add* a variable called `cover` to the dataframe of estimates you created in the last question (Q6) that is `1` if the population slope is in the interval and `0` if not.**  

::: callout-tip
As a reminder, we set `slope = 1` in the data generation (Q4) so the true population slope is $\beta_1 = 1$.
:::

```{r}
#| label: check-coverage

```

**8. Now put this all together into a function called `mycifun()`! The
function should have three required arguments:** 

- `beta0`,
- `beta1`, and
- `n` (the number of observations in the simulated data).** 

**The function should complete the steps in Q4-7 given these arguments:**

- generate one synthetic dataset based on the data generating model specified
- fit a linear regression model to the simulated data
- check that the **population slope** is contained in the estimated 95%
confidence interval for the sample slope
  
**The output of the function should be a data frame (or tibble) with one row 
and four columns:**

- the slope estimate, 
- lower bound of the CI, 
- upper bound of the CI, and 
- whether the population slope is within the CI.

```{r}
#| label: ci-sim-function


```

**9. Run the code below to test your function.**

```{r}
#| label: small-test-ci-fun

mycifun(beta0 = 1, beta1 = 2, n = 1000)
```


**10. Now run this simulation 1,000 times using `map()` and the function you wrote (`mycifun()`). Generate data with $\beta_0 = 3$, $\beta_1 = .5$ and $n = 100$. Make sure to add a line of code to make your simulation reproducible every time you run it.** 

```{r}
#| label: run-ci-sim


ci_dat <- map(.x = 1:1000,
              .f = 
              )
```

**11. Use the `bind_rows()` function from the dplyr package to glue each row
of your simulation together. The result of this step should be a data frame
(or tibble) with 1,000 rows and 4 columns.**

```{r}
#| label: bind-simulated-dataset

```


**12. What is your simulated coverage rate? In otherwords, for what proportion of the iterations was the population slope within the estimated 95% confidence interval?**

```{r}
#| label: sim-cov


```

**13. Create a visualization to illustrate the coverage rate.**

You can create any visualization that effectively illustrates the concept. I
included a plot below with my idea of an effective plot to illustrate the
concept of coverage. Actually, a professor showed me a plot like this in
undergrad and I have always remembered it! 

:::callout-tip
You do not need to exactly copy the plot, even if you choose to do something like it.  A couple of hints to get you started on making a plot like this one:

- Check out `geom_errorbar()`
- Check out `geom_vline()` for the line indicating the true population slope
- Check out the **ggtext** package for [including colors in a title rather than a legend](https://atheobold.github.io/groupworthy-data-science/labs/instructions/challenge-2-instructions.html#hot-embedding-the-legend-in-the-plot-title.
- I took a random sample of 100 simulations to make my plot easier to look at.
