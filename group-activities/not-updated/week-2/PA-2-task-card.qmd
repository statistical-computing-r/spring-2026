title: "PA2 Task Card - Using Data Visualization to Find the Penguins"
editor: source
format: pdf
---

Today you will be exploring different types of visualizations to uncover which
species of penguins reside on different islands.

***This task is complex. It requires many different types of abilities. Everyone
will be good at some of these abilities but nobody will be good at all of them.
In order to solve this puzzle, you will need to use the skills of each member of
your group.***

## Group Roles

When you are the **Developer**, you will type into the Quarto document in
RStudio. However, you **do not** type your own ideas. Instead, you type what 
the Coder tells you to type. You are permitted to ask the Coder clarifying
questions, and, if both of you have a question, you are permitted to ask the
professor. You are expected to run the code provided by the Coder and, if 
necessary, to work with the Coder to debug the code. Once the code runs, you
are expected to collaborate with the Coder to write code comments that describe
the actions taken by your code.

When you are the **Coder**, you are responsible for reading the 
instructions / prompts and directing the Developer what to type in the Quarto
document. You are responsible for managing the resources your group has
available to you (e.g., cheatsheet, textbook). If necessary, you should work
with the Developer to debug the code you specified. Once the code runs, you
are expected to collaborate with the Developer to write code comments that
describe the actions taken by your code.

## Group Norms

Remember, your group is expected to adhere to the following norms:

1.  Think and work together. Do not divide the work.
2.  You are smarter together.
3.  Be open minded. 
4.  No cross-talk with other groups.
5.  Communicate with each other!

# Writing Code

Writing "tidy" and "well documented" code are two of the learning targets for
this course. As such, I would strongly encourage you to use every opportunity to
practice these skills.

## Tidy Code

As you are writing code for this assignment, make sure your code
follows the [tidyverse style guide for ggplot code](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html).
Specifically, your code should:

-   use whitespace liberally
    -   before & after every `=` sign
    -   after every `,`
    -   before every `+`
-   use new lines liberally
    -   after every `+`
    -   after `,` when needed (if code is more than 80 characters in length)

## Well Documented Code

Include a comment at the beginning of the code chunk
that briefly states the purpose of the chunk (comments come after `#` signs). In
addition, if your code involves many steps or steps you needed to look up / get
help on, I would encourage you to write a code comment on what is happening in
these lines.

```{r}
#| label: code-comment-example
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, 
                     fill = species
       ) +
# use fill instead of color to get the bars filled entirely with color (instead of just on the outside)
  
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "", 
       title = "Number of Penguins Captured in the Palmer Archipelago") +
# remove axis titles and put that information in the title where it is easier to read
  
  theme(legend.position = "none")
# to remove the legend position, since the fill information is already included on the x-axis
```
