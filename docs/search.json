Here, you will find three options for installing R—click on the option for your computer’s operating system.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Windows user:\n\nClick on “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on the Download link.\nWhen you open the execution file (.exe) you will be prompted with a variety of questions about installing R. Feel free to use the default features / settings that come with R (continue to click “Ok” until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningMultiple Versions of R\n\n\n\nBeware that if you had a previous version of R downloaded on your PC, that old version will not be deleted when you download the most recent version of R. We do not want to have two versions of R installed, as your computer can get confused what version of R to use. So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of July 1, 2024 was R-4.4.1 (Race for Your Life).\nWhen installing, use the default features / settings that come with R (click Ok until the download starts).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTroubleshooting for Macs\n\n\n\nFirst, identify which version of OSx you are running. How-to\nNext, find out which version of R your computer can run. Link\nIf this version is 3.6 or later, download the latest version that your computer can handle.\nIf this version is 3.4 or earlier, you’re going to run in to some trouble. I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

There is not an expectation that you have seen R before, only that you have some experiences with computing (writing code and executing code). For those who have not seen R before, it is an open-source programming language developed by Statisticians, and is one of the main “languages” you will find people use when doing statistics in the wild.\nIn this course, we will learn the foundational skills for programming in R and a variety of skills for working with data. We will then build on these skills to consider how to write programs which are more efficient.\n\nTeaching Team and Office Hours\nInstructor: Dr. Judith Canner\n Email: jcanner@csumb.edu\n Office: Chapman Science Center, inside S216\n Office Hours: TBD\n Classroom Learning Assistant: Noah Kan\n\n\n\nCourse Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Science Center (53) S222\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday 2:00pm - 3:50pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexts\nThe main text book is: R for Data Science by Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund.

Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: This is what is called a “relational” comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\nsum(ts9 &lt; 17)\n\n\nHint: To update an object after performing an operation, you overwrite the existing object with its updated counterpart. This looks something like this:\nx &lt;- x + 12,\nwhere the original value(s) in x have had 12 added to them, and the resulting values are put back in to the object named x. Be careful with this - if you do something wrong you will need to rerun the previous code chunks to reset everything! Fortunately, the grey arrow pointing down to the green line in each code chunk runs all previous code chunks again.\nNext, carry out the following steps:\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\n\n\nts_mat &lt;- matrix(ts9, ncol = 5) \n\n\nSeparately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 382. Name it “evens”. That is, “evens” should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 382.\n\n\nevens &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 382, by = 2)\n\n\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\n\n\nts_mat[, 1] &lt;- ts_mat[, 1] - evens\n\n\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\n\n\nts_mat[18:24, 3] &lt;- ts_mat[18:24, 3] - 100\n\n\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\n\n\nts_mat[, 4:5] &lt;- ts_mat[, 4:5]*2 \n\n\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\nts_vec &lt;- as.vector(ts_mat)\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector!\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 100\nsum(ts_vec[500:955] &gt;= 100)\n\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\n\n\nts_vec[38:465] &lt;- sqrt(ts_vec[38:465])\n\n\nUse the round() function to round all numbers to the nearest whole number.\n\n\nts_vec &lt;- round(ts_vec, digits = 0)\n\n\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20. Hint: Step 18 requires another relational comparison, but this time it is equality. Equality in R is checked with a double equal sign rather than a single equal sign\n\n\nts_vec[ts_vec == 39 ] &lt;- 20 \n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 344 even numbers.\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder.

Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: This is what is called a “relational” comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\nNext, carry out the following steps:\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\nSeparately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 382. Name it “evens”. That is, “evens” should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 382.\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n## Code to carry out steps 10-15\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector!\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 100\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\nUse the round() function to round all numbers to the nearest whole number.\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\nHint: Step 18 requires another relational comparison, but this time it is equality. Equality in R is checked with a double equal sign rather than a single equal sign!\n\n# Code for steps 16-18\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 344 even numbers.\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector"

    "text": "3.1 Revisions\nThe grading system for this class encourages you to submit revisions on Lab and Challenge problems you were not initially successful with. When I grade your Lab and Challenge assignments, I will mark each problem with an S, a G, or an N. You will have the option to retry any Learning Targets for which you scored a G or an N on. When you complete revisions, you will submit a new HTML containing your revisions, alongside written reflections of how your understanding changed from when you first attempted the problem. These reflections are expected to be written immediately below the problem which you revised.\nIt’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—I need you to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nIf your revisions do not include reflections by the deadline, your revisions are not eligible to be regraded.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from my STAT 313 course, but I think you’ll get the idea.\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of any outstanding revisions each person has.\n\nIt is my goal to have your lab and challenge assignments (which are due on Monday at 5pm) back to you no later than Thursday, so we can spend time talking about the revisions during class. You will then have until the following Friday to complete your revisions on the problems you received a G or an N on.\n\n\n\nNote that I have chosen this deadline because I’m juggling two competing desires, (1) to step away from my email on the weekend, and (2) to make sure people’s questions get answered before the assignment is due.↩︎"

You will often have the choice of what direction you would like to expand your knowledge. There are no specific requirements for how you extend your skills, only that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.\n\n\nRevise Your Thinking\nFor the problems in each Lab Assignment, I will give copious written feedback, but I’ll also summarize my feedback with a letter on the SGN scale (as discussed previously). To demonstrate your ability to revise your thinking, I encourage you to revise and resubmit any problems marked G or N."

    "section": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member",
    "text": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member\nThere are two ways you will evaluate your growth as a team member. The first is through your collaboration with your team members. The second is through the code reviews you provide your peers.\n\nCollaborative Group Work\nThis course uses collaborative learning to provide a supportive community when initially exploring the concepts associated with each week. On Tuesdays, you will collaborate in assigned teams to complete a Practice Activity. Collaborating on the Practice Activity is more than independently coding each task and asking someone a question when you get stuck. Collaborating is working together with your team to accomplish each question.\nMany people are uncomfortable working in a team for a variety of reasons, such as fearing looking dumb, being rejected, or being disrespected. It is my hope that our weekly collaborations will offer opportunities for you to grow as a group member, by becoming more aware of how you interact with others.\nDuring the first week of class, each of you will be placed in a group with one other student. During Weeks 2-5, you will work with this person on the Practice Activities we complete during class on Tuesdays. To make group collaborations more equitable, I expect for you and your partner to alternative between two “roles”—Developer and Coder. We will discuss these roles in class, but you can find descriptions of the scope of each role on the Pair Programming Roles document.\n\n\nPeer Code Review\nOne of my favorite sayings is “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Code review has two major benefits, (1) you get feedback on the readability, tidiness, and efficiency of your code, and (2) by reviewing someone else’s code you learn more about your own code!\nHere are some guidelines and examples of what you should be looking for and how to phrase your peer code reviews.\nYou hopefully noticed that writing “tidy” and “efficient” code are two of the Learning Targets for this course. To demonstrate proficiency in these targets, you will earn badges from your peers. For each lab assignment, everyone in the class will provide an anonymous review of someone’s code. The reviewer will provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of the code they are reviewing. I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It’s easy to be a jerk when making comments; don’t. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other."

It is incredibly helpful for others in the course to see the questions you have and the responses to those questions. I will try to answer any questions posted to Discord within 3-4 hours (unless it is posted at midnight). If you think you can answer another student’s question, please respond!"

One token can purchase a 24-hour extension for a Lab or Challenge Assignment (not a Preview Activity or Practice Activity). If you want to use a token for a deadline extension, you are required to complete the Deadline Extension Form. Akin to how the “real world” works, deadline extensions are requested to be done before the deadline. If you thought you were going to get an assignment in but you just missed the deadline for an assignment, please go complete a deadline extension request ASAP. I will not provide feedback on assignments which missed the deadline and no extension request was completed.\nTokens cannot be “stacked”; you cannot use multiple tokens to purchase a 6-day extension. You can keep track of how many Tokens you have on Canvas.\nYou’ll also have opportunities to earn more tokens during the quarter! You can earn one (1) token by:\n\nAnswering a content or coding question posed on Discord\nCompleting an exemplary Challenge Assignment – applauded by Dr. Theobold for going above and beyond\nAttending every class session (including portfolio parties)"

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. Students in this class are encouraged and expected to speak up and participate during class meetings, and to carefully and respectfully listen to each other. During the first few weeks of class, we’ll work together to create a set of norms that will govern our interactions with each other, to ensure that we’re always respectful of everyone.\nSo that everyone feels comfortable participating, every member of this class must show respect for every other member of this class. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn summary: Be good to each other."

Estimates for regional military expenditure have been extended backwards depending on availability of data, but no estimates for total world military expenditure are available before 1988 due to the lack of data from the Soviet Union.\nSIPRI military expenditure data is based on open sources only."

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important—such as file management.\nEvidently, there has been a bit of generational shift as computers have evolved: the “file system” metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore. This article is an interesting discussion of the problem: it makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet.\n\nFile Systems\nRegardless of how you tend to organize your personal files, it is probably helpful to understand the basics of what is meant by a computer file system – a way to organize data stored on a hard drive. Since data is always stored as 0’s and 1’s, it’s important to have some way to figure out what type of data is stored in a specific location, and how to interpret it.\n\n\n Stop watching at 4:16.\n\n\nFile Paths\nThat’s not enough, though - we also need to know how computers remember the location of what is stored where. Specifically, we need to understand file paths.\nWhen you write a program, you may have to reference external files - data stored in a .csv file, for instance, or a picture. Best practice is to create a file structure that contains everything you need to run your entire project in a single file folder (you can, and sometimes should, have sub-folders).\n\n\n\nFor now, it is enough to know how to find files using file paths, and how to refer to a file using a relative file path from your base folder. In this situation, your “base folder” is known as your working directory - the place your program thinks of as home.",

You can either create a new folder on your computer containing an R Project (e.g., you have not yet created a folder for this class) or you can add an R Project to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you have already created a folder for this class).\n\nCreate with a new folderAdd to an existing folder\n\n\nTo create a R Project, first open RStudio on your computer and click File &gt; New Project, then:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive your folder a name (it shouldn’t be my-stat331 but something that reflects STAT 210, e.g. stat-210-sp26). However, it is good practice for this file folder name to not contain spaces.\nThen, browse on your computer for a location to save this folder to. For example, mine is saved in my Documents. Make sure you know how to find this; it should NOT be saved in your Downloads!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new folder should now live in your Documents folder (or wherever you save it to) and contain a stat-210-sp26.Rproj file or whatever you named it. This is your new “home” base for this class - whenever you refer to a file with a relative path it will begin to look for it here.\n\n\nTo add a R Project to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you already created a folder for this class), first open RStudio on your computer and click File &gt; New Project, then:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, browse on your computer to select the existing folder you wish to add your R Project to. For example, mine is saved in my Documents and called my-stat331.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour existing folder should now contain a my-stat331.Rproj file. This is your new “home” base for this class - whenever you refer to a file with a relative path it will begin to look for it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionYour folder cannot sync with anything online!\n\n\n\nYour STAT 210 folder cannot be in a folder stored on OneDrive or iCloud!

    "text": "2.2 Introduction to Quarto\n\n📖 Required Reading: Intro to Quarto\n\n\nHTML Documents\nWe will exclusively use HTML documents in this course. If you are interested in learning more about formatting options for Quarto HTML documents, I would recommend checking out:\n\na discussion of the basics of formatting HTML documents in Quarto\nthe list of all HTML formatting options for Quarto documents\n\nThe biggest thing to realize is that a Quarto document contains three types of content:\n\nA YAML header surrounded by ---s at the top.\nChunks of R code surrounded by ```{r} and ```.\nText mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.\n\nFor our class (STAT 250), you will generally only be editing the Chunks and the Text.\n\n\nBasic Markdown\nMarkdown can format a document just like you format your Word documents in other classes, but we’ll just cover some of the basics here. You’ve already learned italics, bold and code displays. Markdown can make lists as well, using a variety of encoding (see the online tutorial). You’ve probably also noticed that when you format your text, its color display changes, to help you see the formatting easier.\n\n\nUnrendered\n\n\nRendered\n\n\n\n\n*italics*  or _italics_\n\n\nitalics or italics\n\n\n\n\n**bold**\n\n\nbold\n\n\n\n\n`code`  \n\n\ncode\n\n\n\n\nsubscript~2~    \n\n\nsubscript2\n\n\n\n\nsuperscript^2^  \n\n\nsuperscript2\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Text block for answers\n\n\n\nText block for answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Header Size 1\n\n\nHeader Size 1\n\n\n\n\n## Header Size 2\n\n\nHeader Size 2\n\n\n\n\n\n### Header Size 3\n\n\nHeader Size 3\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Comments Will Not Render: &lt;!--- this comment won't show up rendered ---&gt;\n\n\nMarkdown Comments Will Not Render: \n\n\nOne last thing of note - markdown works best with “space to breathe.” If you find that something isn’t rendering correctly, making sure there is a blank line between the text you are trying to format and the next helps.\n\n\nFor example:\n&gt; Although this is green unrendered, it doesn't appear with the formatting we want. Try adding an \"enter\" between the \"For example:\" and the start of this line and render again. Did it fix it?\nYou'll also notice that if there are no line breaks, this formatting doesn't end, so you don't need to put a \"&gt;\" before each line answer. \n\n\nFor example: &gt; Although this is green unrendered, it doesn’t appear with the formatting we want. Try adding an “enter” between the “For example:” and the start of this line and render again. Did it fix it? You’ll also notice that if there are no line breaks, this formatting doesn’t end, so you don’t need to put a “&gt;” before each line answer.\n\n\nNotice what happens when we add spacing:\n\n\nFor example:\n\n&gt; Although this is green unrendered, it doesn't appear with the formatting we want. Try adding an \"enter\" between the \"For example:\" and the start of this line and render again.

You’ll also notice that if there are no line breaks, this formatting doesn’t end, so you don’t need to put a “&gt;” before each line answer.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics\nWe often want to write small mathematics equations or write mathematical symbols. This is actually much easier in .qmd than in Word.\nWe surround an equation with $ signs: $e=mc^2$ which will appear as \\(e=mc^2\\) in the rendered document.\nHere are some examples of the type of mathematics you will use within your Quarto documents.\n\nGreek Letters\nWe often want to use statistical symbols within markdown to denote parameters with Greek letters. They are called by using a backslash (\\) and then the full name of the Greek letter, such as \\alpha, and surrounded by $ to be called within the equation-mode:\n\n\n$\\sigma$  \n$\\alpha$  \n$\\mu$  \n$\\beta$  \n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\)\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\\(\\mu\\)\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\n\n\nSuperscripts and Subscripts\nWe can include sub- and superscripts to make our parameters and statistics specific. Note: once the equation is surrounded by $’s we don’t need the markdown edit for superscript like above. In math mode, you might see:\n\n\n$x^2$  \n$H_0$  \n$\\mu_1$  \n\n\n\\(x^2\\)\n\\(H_0\\)\n\\(\\mu_1\\)\n\n\nWe might want to make our subscript a longer phrase in statistics, to help denote our population of interest when we have more than one. We surround whatever we want to stay in a subscript with {}, such as:\n\n\n$\\mu_{female}$  \n$\\mu_{male}$  \n\n\n\\(\\mu_{female}\\)\n\\(\\mu_{male}\\)\n\n\n\n\nSymbols over Letters\nWe can call our special statistical symbols in a similar way, such as \\bar{x}. In this case, the bar symbol will be applied over the x, to make our statistical symbol for sample mean: \\(\\bar{x}\\).\n\n\n$\\bar{x}$  \n$\\hat{p}$  \n$\\hat{\\beta}_1$  \n\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\)\n\\(\\hat{p}\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\)\n\n\n\n\nEquations\nFinally, we can write little equations for our outputs:, like \\(\\bar{x} = 3.54\\).\n\n\n$\\bar{x} = 3.54$  \n$\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x$  \n\n\n\\(\\bar{x} = 3.54\\)\n\\(\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Chunks\nYou’ve learned how to insert code chunks using the shortcuts Ctrl-Alt-I (or Cmd-Alt-I), by clicking the green Insert +C button above, but you can also just type the two sets of code that surround code chunks, ```{r} and the ending ``` . Note, those are back-ticks, found above the tab key, not single quotation marks.\nWe can add labels #| label: to support easy navigation as well, but be careful, DO NOT REPEAT LABELS or this will cause an error when you render the .qmd file.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: simple-addition\n1 + 1\n```\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nAt the beginning of each Quarto document there should be a special code chunk called the setup chunk. This is where we read the packages used in the rest of the document. We often use #| include: false to as an option in the setup code chunk to hide the output in the rendered document.\nYou can also comment your code, which is a way of annotating it without affecting the code, using a # followed by text.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: print-answer\n42*42  #the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, Squared\n```\n\n[1] 1764\n\n\n\n\nChecking code & Rendering your Document\nYou can run specific code chunks to check their output by pressing the green play button to run the specific code chunk, or the icon next to it to run all code chunks prior to that code chunk.\n\nViewing Your Rendered Document\nIf you want to check your Markdown editing, you can render the document and view it in the ‘Viewer’ Pane by pressing the ‘Render’ button at the top of the Quarto document pane. Make sure the setting (gear icon above) is set to ‘Preview in Viewer pane’.\n\n\nChanging the Document Type\nYou can change the document type you knit to automatically by changing the output type in the YAML header from format: html to format: docx and press the ‘Render’ button. Your word document will be created in the project folder! (In this class, we will always use html documents; please don’t edit the YAML header of your labs; we showed you this simply for future information.)\n---\ntitle: \"My report\"\nformat: html\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  error: false\n---  \n\n\nErrors in your Code\nIf there is an error in your file, it will not render. When .qmd files render, they run on a completely clean environment. So if you somehow loaded data or something else not with code in your .qmd file, the rendering process will create an error.\nIf you cannot figure out the error, you can generally still get your document to render by changing error: false to error: true in the YAML code at the top.\n---\ntitle: \"My report\"\nformat: html\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  error: true\n---  \nThis will print out any errors in your code chunks, but still render the document.\n\n\nErrors in your Markdown\nThe most common errors in your markdown that can cause issues are deleting back ticks (`) around your code chunks or dashes (-) from around the YAML code, so always check that first.",
