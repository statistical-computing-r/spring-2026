    "text": "Have you ever wondered…\n\n…how are the visualizations you see in the media made?\n…how do people cut down large datasets to address a specific question?\n…how the applet simulations in your statistics classes work? \n\nWe’ll answer these questions and more by studying the principles of “statistical computing” methods in the programming language called R. There is not an expectation that you have seen R before, only that you have some experiences with computing (writing code and executing code). For those who have not seen R before, it is an open-source programming language developed by Statisticians, and is one of the main “languages” you will find people use when doing statistics in the wild.\nIn this course, we will learn the foundational skills for programming in R and a variety of skills for working with data. We will then build on these skills to consider how to write programs which are more efficient.\n\nTeaching Team and Office Hours\nInstructor: Dr. Judith Canner\n Email: jcanner@csumb.edu\n Office: Chapman Science Center, inside S216\n Office Hours: TBD\n Classroom Learning Assistant: Noah Kan\n Teaching Assistant: NA\n\n\nCourse Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Science Center (53) S222\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday 2:00pm - 3:50pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexts\nThe main text book is: R for Data Science by Wickham, Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund.

    "text": "3.1 Revisions\nThe grading system for this class encourages you to submit revisions on Lab and Challenge problems you were not initially successful with. When I grade your Lab and Challenge assignments, I will mark each problem with an S, a G, or an N. You will have the option to retry any Learning Targets for which you scored a G or an N on. When you complete revisions, you will submit a new HTML containing your revisions, alongside written reflections of how your understanding changed from when you first attempted the problem. These reflections are expected to be written immediately below the problem which you revised.\nIt’s not enough to say “[x] was wrong, so I fixed it”—I need you to talk about why you got [x] wrong in the first place and what you learned that changed your mind. What do you know now that you didn’t know before? Who or what helped you learn?\n\nIf your revision does not include reflections, I’ll ask you to add them.\nIf your revisions do not include reflections by the deadline, your revisions are not eligible to be regraded.\nSee some examples of really good reflections here – they’re (mostly) from my STAT 313 course, but I think you’ll get the idea.\nSubmit your revision to the same assignment box on Canvas as your original. This helps me keep track of any outstanding revisions each person has.\n\nIt is my goal to have your lab and challenge assignments (which are due on Monday at 5pm) back to you no later than Thursday, so we can spend time talking about the revisions during class. You will then have until the following Friday to complete your revisions on the problems you received a G or an N on.\n\n\n\nNote that I have chosen this deadline because I’m juggling two competing desires, (1) to step away from my email on the weekend, and (2) to make sure people’s questions get answered before the assignment is due.↩︎"

You can demonstrate proficiency with these skills through three main avenues: Group-based Practice Activities Lab Assignments Challenge Assignments\nHowever, evidence of continued learning can only be demonstrated within individual lab assignments.

These assignments provide two different perspectives of your continued learning.\n\nThey demonstrate your ability to extend your thinking beyond what you’ve learned in class.\nThey demonstrate your ability to revise your thinking.\n\n\nExtend Your Thinking\nEach Lab Assignment will have a Challenge Problem which asks you to extend the skills you’ve learned in class in a new way. You will often have the choice of what direction you would like to expand your knowledge. There are no specific requirements for how you extend your skills, only that you extend your thinking in some (measurable) way.\n\n\nRevise Your Thinking\nFor the problems in each Lab Assignment, I will give copious written feedback, but I’ll also summarize my feedback with a letter on the SGN scale (as discussed previously). To demonstrate your ability to revise your thinking, I encourage you to revise and resubmit any problems marked G or N."

    "section": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member",
    "text": "4.3 Growth as a Team Member\nThere are two ways you will evaluate your growth as a team member. The first is through your collaboration with your team members. The second is through the code reviews you provide your peers.\n\nCollaborative Group Work\nThis course uses collaborative learning to provide a supportive community when initially exploring the concepts associated with each week. On Tuesdays, you will collaborate in assigned teams to complete a Practice Activity. Collaborating on the Practice Activity is more than independently coding each task and asking someone a question when you get stuck. Collaborating is working together with your team to accomplish each question.\nMany people are uncomfortable working in a team for a variety of reasons, such as fearing looking dumb, being rejected, or being disrespected. It is my hope that our weekly collaborations will offer opportunities for you to grow as a group member, by becoming more aware of how you interact with others.\nDuring the first week of class, each of you will be placed in a group with one other student. During Weeks 2-5, you will work with this person on the Practice Activities we complete during class on Tuesdays. To make group collaborations more equitable, I expect for you and your partner to alternative between two “roles”—Developer and Coder. We will discuss these roles in class, but you can find descriptions of the scope of each role on the Pair Programming Roles document.\n\n\nPeer Code Review\nOne of my favorite sayings is “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Code review has two major benefits, (1) you get feedback on the readability, tidiness, and efficiency of your code, and (2) by reviewing someone else’s code you learn more about your own code!\nHere are some guidelines and examples of what you should be looking for and how to phrase your peer code reviews.\nYou hopefully noticed that writing “tidy” and “efficient” code are two of the Learning Targets for this course. To demonstrate proficiency in these targets, you will earn badges from your peers. For each lab assignment, everyone in the class will provide an anonymous review of someone’s code. The reviewer will provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of the code they are reviewing. I will provide some examples of helpful and unhelpful feedback, to guide your feedback. It’s easy to be a jerk when making comments; don’t. Think about the comments you would like to receive that would help you improve your code! Be good to each other."

If you want to use a token for a deadline extension, you are required to complete the Deadline Extension Form. Akin to how the “real world” works, deadline extensions are requested to be done before the deadline. If you thought you were going to get an assignment in but you just missed the deadline for an assignment, please go complete a deadline extension request ASAP. I will not provide feedback on assignments which missed the deadline and no extension request was completed.\nTokens cannot be “stacked”; you cannot use multiple tokens to purchase a 6-day extension.

In my classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. Students in this class are encouraged and expected to speak up and participate during class meetings, and to carefully and respectfully listen to each other. During the first few weeks of class, we’ll work together to create a set of norms that will govern our interactions with each other, to ensure that we’re always respectful of everyone.\nSo that everyone feels comfortable participating, every member of this class must show respect for every other member of this class. Any attitude or belief that espouses the superiority of one group of people over another is not welcome in my classroom. Such beliefs are directly destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create, and will sabotage our ability to learn from each other (and thus sabotage the entire structure of the course).\nIn summary: Be good to each other."
